## 🔬 Current Research

### AR + Diffusion Parallel Generation with Qwen and LLaDA

I am currently working on a hybrid generation framework that combines:

- **Autoregressive language models (Qwen-2.5B)** for draft generation and high-level semantic planning
- **Diffusion-based language models (LLaDA)** for parallel refinement and token-level correction

The primary motivation of this work is to address the inherent sequential bottleneck of autoregressive decoding while preserving strong semantic coherence. By leveraging AR models to produce structured drafts and diffusion models to refine these drafts in parallel, the framework aims to achieve an improved trade-off between decoding efficiency and generation quality.

**Key research components:**
- Draft-based parallel decoding strategy
- Strict-match and flexible-extract evaluation protocols
- Training and inference optimization on small-to-medium scale language models
